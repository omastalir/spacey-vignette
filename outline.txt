Installation 
  Provide instructions and code (~2 sentences)
    Installing the Spacey package requires one to download via: install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("mikemahoney218/spacey") since Spacey is not yet approved for the CRAN directory.  

Functions
  Quick Overview of the 3 main functions spacey provides (1-2 sentences each) (automap, get_heightmap, get_image_overlay)
    automap: https://mikemahoney218.github.io/spacey/articles/automap-walkthrough.html. Inputs: can be just a coordinate pair     as latitude, longitude, but has many options (e.g. map overlays (filters), saving file options and zoom). There is also       the possibility to 3d render the image generated, but this is option is admitidly not fully developed. 
    get_heightmap: Retrieves an elevation map from the USGS (database of heights for US). This raster is then translated into     an R matrix. 
    get_image_overlay: Using ESRI's filters, applies a layer onto a map generated with automap. 
  Quick overview of the other helper functions (1 sent each) (get_centroid_bounding_box, get_coord_bounding_box, get_centroid,   load_heightmap, load_overlay, rad_to_deg, deg_to_rad)
    get_centroid: finds the central location given matched longitutde and latitude vectors. 
    get_centroid_bounding_box: allows a box of varying size to be created given a central point. 
    get_coord_bounding_box: creates a rectangle with the least area given a set of list of lat/long coordinates. 
    load_heightmap: imports .tif files from local client to be used for height mapping on images. 
    load_overlay: layer for maps that loads into environment themes from ESRI (limited). 
    rad_to_deg: converts radians to degrees for visualizing map. 
    deg_to_read: converts degrees to radians for visualizing map. 
    All functions are able to run with the magrittr pipe (%>%) which serves the same function as the tidyverse pipe. 
    
  Mike's github has a thorough overview of these functions, could use that
  Mention that they are usable with magrittr pipe %>%

Usage
  Quick description
  Automap
    Automap is well documented by Mike already
    Hard to read though - Break up his work into sections with appropriate headers
    Provide more examples if we see fit
  Heightmap and Overlay (This is the section that we could probably improve the most!)
    Provide more examples and images
    Emphasize the flow of creating a bounding box, feeding to to these functions to produce a matrix, and then using rayshader to map the matrix
