Installation 
  Provide instructions and code (~2 sentences)

Functions
  Quick Overview of the 3 main functions spacey provides (1-2 sentences each) (automap, get_heightmap, get_image_overlay)
  Quick overview of the other helper functions (1 sent each) (get_centroid_bounding_box, get_coord_bounding_box, get_centroid, load_heightmap, load_overlay, rad_to_deg, deg_to_rad)
  Mike's github has a thorough overview of these functions, could use that
  Mention that they are usable with magrittr pipe %>%

Usage
  Quick description
  Automap
    Automap is well documented by Mike already
    Hard to read though - Break up his work into sections with appropriate headers
    Provide more examples if we see fit
  Heightmap and Overlay (This is the section that we could probably improve the most!)
    Provide more examples and images
    Emphasize the flow of creating a bounding box, feeding to to these functions to produce a matrix, and then using rayshader to map the matrix
